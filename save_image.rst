Retain a Shared Image Forever
*****************************

You are the consumer Jill and producer Darin is sharing image ``af1234c9-6d07-5f1f-b642-01d9df26ed51`` with you. Darin will only share the image with you for as long as he decides. When he no longer wants to share that image, he can simply remove you as a member and you no longer have access to that image. 

The simple answer
-----------------
To retain a shared image forever, do these simple steps:

1) Create a server off of the shared image.

2) Go into the newly create server and use it for a short time. This is only to test out the new server and make sure there were no issues with it during the creation process.

3) Create a image off of the new server. This will be your newly saved image that is a copy of the shared image!

It is recommended to spawn another server off of the new image that you just created to test it(again) and make sure it is good(as you did on step #2). It never hurts to be extra carefull and to make sure there were no issues. If everything went correctly, then you have a image that is a copy of the shared image! This image you wil keep even if the producer decides to remove the image he/she is sharing with you.
