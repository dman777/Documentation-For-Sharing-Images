Do you own your own business where you build servers for customers? Perhaps, you created a very success full website and sold it. Now you need to transfer that webserver to the lucky person you sold it to. Or, maybe you are just a hobbyist that wants to share that awesome Ghost blogging webserver you spent hours building, hardening, and you want to share it with your IRC friend. If so, then image sharing is for you!
